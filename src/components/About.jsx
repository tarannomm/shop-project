        Customer buying behaviour in digital environment The marketing around
        the digital environment, customer's buying behaviour may not be
        influenced and controlled by the brand and firm, when they make a buying
        decision that might concern the interactions with search engine,
        recommendations, online reviews and other information. In modern
        shopping environments, people are more likely to use their mobile
        phones, computers, tablets and other digital devices to gather
        information. In an online shopping environment, interactive decision may
        have an influence on aid customer decision making, through online
        product reviews and user-generated content, typically provided through
        software from companies like Bazaarvoice and Trustpilot, or via social
        media. This content, which can include text or video-based reviews,
        customer photos, and feedback, is often displayed alongside products
        being sold on websites like Amazon, Target, and most other digital
        storefronts. Subsequently, risk and trust would also are two important
        factors affecting people's' behavior in digital environments. Customers
        consider to switch between e-channels, because they are mainly influence
        by the comparison with offline shopping, involving growth of security,
        financial and performance-risks In other words, a customer shopping
        online that they may receive more risk than people shopping in stores.
        There are three factors may influence people to do the buying decision,
        firstly, people cannot examine whether the product satisfy their needs
        and wants before they receive it. Secondly, customer may concern at
        after-sale services. Finally, customer may afraid that they cannot fully
        understand the language used in e-sales. Based on those factors customer
        perceive risk may as a significantly reason influence the online
        purchasing behaviour. Online retailers has place much emphasis on
        customer trust aspect, trust is another way driving customer's behaviour
        in digital environment, which can depend on customer's attitude and
        expectation. Indeed, the company's products design or ideas can not met
        customer's expectations. Customer's purchase intention based on rational
        expectations, and additionally impacts on emotional trust. Moreover,
        those expectations can be also establish on the product information and
        revision from others. In several studies, perceived value, shopping
        style, and brand trust are the main factors that affect online
        consumers' decisions. The perceived value means that people can compare
        the products and prices online, bringing them the perceived value of
        getting more benefits online than in an offline store.[28] The
        comfortable environment that online shopping brings to customers can
        make consumers get more perceived value. Product selection. Further
        information: Buyer decision process Consumers find a product of interest
        by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among
        alternative vendors using a shopping search engine. Users can compare
        and evaluate products using product information on the website, as well
        on other websites such as websites about product tests. Once a
        particular product has been found and selected on the website of the
        seller, most online retailers use shopping cart software to allow the
        consumer to accumulate multiple items and to adjust quantities, like
        filling a physical shopping cart or basket in a conventional store. A
        "checkout" process follows (continuing the physical-store analogy) in
        which payment and delivery information is collected, if necessary. Some
        stores allow consumers to sign up for a permanent online account so that
        some or all of this information only needs to be entered once. The
        consumer often receives an e-mail confirmation once the transaction is
        complete. Less sophisticated stores may rely on consumers to phone or
        e-mail their orders (although full credit card numbers, expiry date, and
        Card Security Code, or bank account and routing number should not be
        accepted by e-mail, for reasons of security). Impact of reviews on
        consumer behavior One of the great benefits of online shopping is the
        ability to read product reviews, written either by experts or fellow
        online shoppers. The Nielsen Company conducted a survey in March 2010
        and polled more than 27,000 Internet users in 55 markets from the
        Asia-Pacific, Europe, Middle East, North America, and South America to
        look at questions such as "How do consumers shop online?", "What do they
        intend to buy?", "How do they use various online shopping web pages?",
        and the impact of social media and other factors that come into play
        when consumers are trying to decide how to spend their money on which
        product or service. According to the research, reviews on
        electronics (57%) such as DVD players, cellphones, or PlayStations, and
        so on, reviews on cars (45%), and reviews on software (37%) play an
        important role in influencing consumers who tend to make purchases
        online. Furthermore, 40% of online shoppers indicate that they would not
        even buy electronics without consulting online reviews first. In
        addition to online reviews, peer recommendations on online shopping
        pages or social media websites play a key role for online shoppers
        when they are researching future purchases. 90% of all purchases
        made are influenced by social media.
